                        A <b>13 Point Heroic Hunter</b> can be turned into <b>Legendary</b> if you use 
                        an Awakening Stone on it. But which stat, you ask? 
                        <br />
                        <b>Aspd, always upgrade Aspd.</b> If a hunter has an <b>orange stat</b>, then it's even better. You want that hunter
                        to have <b>Purple Aspd</b>. 
                        <br />
                        You'll now have a hunter that requires <b>1 less Aspd line</b>,
                        and that 1 extra line makes a difference â€” don't underestimate it!
                    </p>

                        Any <b>13 Point Heroic-turned-Legendary</b> can be banished and you will gain an <b>Awakening Crystal</b>. Not a bad trade! Basically turning your 
                        <b> Awakening Stone </b> into <b> Awakening Crystal</b>.
                        Now, did you even waste your Awakening Stone? If you followed what I mentioned above,
                        you'll realize that you did not.

                        You need to have a mindset that <b>multiple hunters with Purple Aspd</b> are better
                        than a single Ultimate hunter. It's much better to have a few Hunters with Purple Aspd
                        than one Ultimate, because this game can't be done with a single hunter alone
                        â€” but with multiple hunters working together.
